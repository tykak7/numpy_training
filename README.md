# numpy_matplotlib_training

  1.   nearest_point.py
   
Using NumPy, a " **points.csv** " file containing in each line the coordinates of points in two-dimensional Euclidean space was processed.

Without using loops, just using NumPy functions, the point that is closest to the point [0;0] was found.

  1.   matplotlib.py

Display in a suitable way (in one window) using the matplotlib library:

1). Histogram with the number of cokes for numbers from 1 to 10^6
2). Display the number of steps for numbers from 1 to 10^6
3). Display for each number in the range 1-10^6 (X-axis) the highest value reached during the iteration to number 1 (e.g. for number 12 it will be 16)
